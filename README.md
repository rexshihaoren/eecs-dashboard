#EECS-Dashboard

##Goal
Fix up and create a self service dashboard for EECS Department of UC Berkeley (IRIS www.iris.eecs.berkeley.edu).

###Features: 
####1. View quota
As a user who uses storage services, so that I can understand how much storage is available for me, I want to see my storage quota for my projects (current value and some visualization of past history).
####2. Change quota
As a user who uses storage services, so that I can adjust to changes in my project, I want to change my storage quota.
####3. View billing
As a user who uses storage services, so that I can understand what I am being charged, I want to see how much I am being charged given the amount of space I am using.
####4. See who I'm being billed for
As a faculty member, so that I can understand what I'm being charged for, I want to see who I am being billed for (which of my students and how much per student).
